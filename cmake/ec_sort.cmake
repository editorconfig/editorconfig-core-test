# ec_sort.cmake: Run editorconfig and sort its output
# For use in editorconfig; see
# https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig/issues/375 .

# Call as, e.g.:
# cmake -D EDITORCONFIG_CMD="../editorconfig" -D ECARGS:LIST="-f;.editorconfig;foo" -P cmake/ec_sort.cmake
# EDITORCONFIG_CMD may also be list-valued.  EDITORCONFIG_CMD and ECARGS
# are put together on the command line, in that order, and split by CMake.
