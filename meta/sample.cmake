message( "${lines}" )
# This outputs to stderr, and prints nothing extra except for a \n at the end

# Note that message( STATUS "${lines}" ) doesn't work because it outputs a "--"
# before the actual content.

# You could also use execute_process( COMMAND "echo" "${lines}" )
# or cmake -E echo, but I think the message() call is good enough.
